# ImFiddle
Interactive C++ graphics playground

## Motivation
Writing and debugging graphics algorithms is often a tedious and time consuming process of trial and error.

ImFiddle is intended to be a minimalistic alternative to the likes of Processing and P5.js, using C++ instead of other languages to simplify prototyping and code sharing for quick development of visualizations.

It currently supports hot-reloading and has full VSCode integration via CMake. Only Linux is supported at the moment.

## Demo
TODO

## Usage
Requirements: CMake, vcpkg, Clang or GCC.

```
export VCPKG_ROOT=/path/to/vcpkg_root/
code ./ImFiddle
```
