# ImFiddle
Interactive 2D graphics playground for C++

## Motivation
Writing and debugging graphics algorithms is often a tedious and time consuming process of trial and error.

ImFiddle is a minimalistic alternative to the likes of Processing and P5.js, using C++ instead of other languages to simplify prototyping and code sharing for quick development of visualizations.

## Demo
TODO

## Usage
Build requirements: CMake, Clang or GCC.
Run requirements: OpenGL 3.3, Windows or Linux.

Sketches are made of singular .cpp files under `./ImFiddle/Sketches`. These will be re-compiled in real time after changes.

The hot-reloading "JIT" requires that `compile_commands.json` be present in `build/` for dependency resolution. This is automatically generated by the VSCode CMake extension, or alternatively by setting `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS`.

## Potential ideas
- Make into an easily embeddable library for use in existing projects
- Drawing from shaders instead of C++ (via readback buffers like printf)
